## Project Brief
**Scenario:**
We are working as an analyst for a real estate company. Your company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a 
variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

**Challenge:**
Use the given data set to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset.

**Problem:**
Senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tools. One of those parameters includes understanding 
which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.

## Data
Leveraging on the [data](https://github.com/vonate5/midterm_project/tree/main/data_sets) we were provided with, we used Tableau's and Python's data visualisation tools to explore the relationships between features. <br/> <br/>
To find out more about the distribution of the important features we highlighted, you can have a look on our Tableau dashboard below:
